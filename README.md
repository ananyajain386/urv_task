My favorite part of building this portfolio was bringing the design to life using Tailwind CSSâ€”it was satisfying to see how quickly I could prototype and tweak the layout for different screen sizes. The hardest part was setting up routing and handling data correctly in Next.js. I tackled this by reading through the official Next.js documentation and experimenting with different configurations until everything worked smoothly.
